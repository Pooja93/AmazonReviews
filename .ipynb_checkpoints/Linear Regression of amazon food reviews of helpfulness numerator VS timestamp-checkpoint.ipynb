Also, while not an issue about the drink, the can is made of very thin aluminum and is prone to ripping if you crush it, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is an effective energy drink but it isn't as good tasting as the Cola flavor (which I even put it on automatic reorder) but is much better than the Green Tea Raspberry version (which other people seem to like).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"Celsius Calorie ...\"}, \"This Tabanero \\\"Hot Sauce Picante\\\" has a wonderful natural flavor and a good amount of \\\"heat\\\". My family loves hot sauces, but our tolerance range from medium (my wife and son) to fairly hot (me and my daughter), and this is right on upper limit of medium.<br /><br />Some hot sauces are hot just for the sake of being hot, but this is also very flavorful and can be used to enhance salsas, dips, or other foods that could use some zing. I like that the ingredients are all natural, including Habanero peppers, carrots, onions, Key Lime juice, agave, garlic salt, and grapefruit seed extract. Note that this does not contain vinegar like most other hot sauces, and it doesn't miss it all. This has a great fresh pepper flavor that is slightly sweet tasting with a hint of carrot flavor coming through. The sauce has a nice consistency that makes it easy to see how much has been added to your food.<br /><br />It is important to shake the bottle well before serving since this has a tendency to separate, with the hot pepper component rising to the top. I didn't shake it before testing it on my finger tip and found it to quite potent, providing some amusement for my son.<br /><br />This is a very different and enjoyable hot sauce that provides both heat and flavor!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 2, \"value\": \"This Tabanero \\\"Hot ...\"}, \"We have several relatives with dietary restrictions in my family, including gluten and dairy sensitivity, so I was happy to try these Pamela's \\\"Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut\\\" snack bars.

I am an energy drink fan and have developed a taste for the stuff, so liked the flavor of these quite a bit more than my wife that hardly ever uses energy drinks (more of a coffee purist).<br /><br />The \\\"Green Thunder\\\" reminds me of Mountain Dew with a hint of apple flavoring and the \\\"Black Cherry\\\" tastes like, well, Black Cherries. I personally prefer the \\\"Green Thunder\\\" but my teen son and my wife like the flavor of the \\\"Black Cherry\\\" better.<br /><br />These do provide a decent energy boost and the portable bottle makes it convenient to carry with me since they do not have to be refrigerated after opening.

That being said, this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes, but I wouldn't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes. There are hotter sauces available, but this one is a good balance of flavor and heat.<br /><br />There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"\\\"Dave's Insanity ...\"}, \"This illy issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink is very nice served over ice!

We are fortunate to have Indian friends who occasionally invite us to dinner but since we can't always count on an invitation whenever a craving comes on one us, these pre-made packets are a reasonable substitute. Here are my observations:<br /><br />Pros -<br />+ Good Flavor; as noted above, this tastes very good to people that like Indian food (my mother hates it)<br />+ Mildly Spicy; this rates on low to medium of the spicy scale, might be too much heat for some since it \\\"stays with you\\\"<br />+ Low Carb; 22.5g Total Carbs - 5g Dietary Fiber = 17.5 Net Carbs in each packet (see serving size info in \\\"Misc\\\", below)<br /><br />Cons -<br />- \\\"Not as Pictured\\\"; the picture on the packaging shows nice whole peppers, but they are actually cut up in the sauce<br />- Oily; this has a lot of oil that will rise to the top when cooking in a pot (we skim some off)<br />- High in Calories; each packet has 550 calories (400 from fat - but no Trans Fats)<br /><br />Misc -<br />* Serving Size; package says 2.5 per packet, we find that two packets when served with rice and bread is enough for our family of four<br />* Filling; this is a very heavy sauce based dish<br /><br />While not really a standalone meal, this is a good entree that can be used as the main course.

These flavors are from David Klein, the creator of the famous \\\"Jelly Belly\\\" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this sampler to review since my family loves jelly beans. Here are my opinions of the included flavors, in order of my favorites:<br /><br />* Coconut - Very strong natural coconut flavor, my favorite one<br />* Vanilla Bean - Very good tasting, natural vanilla flavor<br />* Pomegranate - Totally nailed this one! So good!<br />* Ginger - Crisp natural ginger flavor, every bit as good as the fresh ginger candy we get locally<br />* Cranberry - Really very good and natural tasting<br />* Root Beer - Amazing, can almost feel the fizz!<br />* Green Apple - So good! Very natural apple flavor!<br />* Peach - Very good juicy peach flavor<br />* Strawberry - Very good, reminds me of strawberry and cream<br />* Lemon - A little milder than expected, very good \\\"clean\\\" flavor<br />* Black Cherry - Very natural tasting but a tad bit over sweet<br />* Grape - Great grape flavor, not quite as strong as expected<br />* Orange Punch - Good flavor, not overpowering<br />* Blueberry - Good, but somewhat understated<br />* Himalayan Sea Salt - Very odd choice for a jelly bean, but it is a surprisingly enjoyable flavor<br />* Bacon - Does indeed taste like sweet smokey bacon, a fun novelty flavor but not one I'm going to eat all the time<br /><br />My list of favorites differs a little in order from other members of my family, as might be expected since everyone has different tastes, but every one of these rates higher than any other manufacturers similar jelly bean flavor we have tried. Combining some of these flavors is also fun with ginger and lemon being my favorite, producing a very clean and refreshing sensation.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with 100% natural flavors and colors, and includes an impressive list of fruit concentrates fairly high up in ingredients list.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"This David's ...\"}, \"These Golden Batch Sugar Free Peanut Wafers are really great tasting and are also fairly filling.

This \\\"Variety Pack\\\" contains several flavors, but the Sparkling Cola is my favorite as it has a crisp ginger taste that I really like and makes it very refreshing, especially when served very cold. The other flavors are: Green Tea Peach Mango (good), Green Tea Raspberry Acai (not my favorite), Sparkling Orange (very good), Sparkling Wild Berry (good), and Sparkling Ginger Ale (very good).<br /><br />While I can't really confirm that these actually burns 100 Calories just by drinking a whole can, it certainly would not surprise me since this does pack a serious kick. I now drink a can of this about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.<br /><br />A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking \\\"too much\\\" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my teenage son tried one before his workout and got \\\"jittery\\\". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the cans are made of very thin aluminum and are prone to ripping if you crush them, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, these are a very good tasting energy drinks that really do get you moving!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"Celsius Calorie ...\"}, \"This very enjoyable \\\"English Breakfast\\\" tea was included in the <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032D8IOC\\\">Celestial Seasonings K-Cups Tea Sampler 44 Cups (Pack of 2)</a> we bought for use in our <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA\\\">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>.<br /><br />It is a very rich, traditional tasting tea that works well in both small and large cup brew sizes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"This very ...\"}, \"Kirkland Jelly Beans are a great value and all 49 flavors are very good tasting.

I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />We have tried almost all of the Dreamfields pastas, but have really enjoyed being able to have lasagna again!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"This great tasting ...\"}, \"Timothy's \\\"Colombian Decaffeinated K-Cups\\\" is very good tasting coffee.

Also, while not an issue about the drink, the can is made of very thin aluminum and is prone to ripping if you crush it, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, this is an effective energy drink but it isn't as good tasting as the Cola flavor (which I even put it on automatic reorder) but is much better than the Green Tea Raspberry version (which other people seem to like).<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"Celsius Calorie ...\"}, \"This Tabanero \\\"Hot Sauce Picante\\\" has a wonderful natural flavor and a good amount of \\\"heat\\\". My family loves hot sauces, but our tolerance range from medium (my wife and son) to fairly hot (me and my daughter), and this is right on upper limit of medium.<br /><br />Some hot sauces are hot just for the sake of being hot, but this is also very flavorful and can be used to enhance salsas, dips, or other foods that could use some zing. I like that the ingredients are all natural, including Habanero peppers, carrots, onions, Key Lime juice, agave, garlic salt, and grapefruit seed extract. Note that this does not contain vinegar like most other hot sauces, and it doesn't miss it all. This has a great fresh pepper flavor that is slightly sweet tasting with a hint of carrot flavor coming through. The sauce has a nice consistency that makes it easy to see how much has been added to your food.<br /><br />It is important to shake the bottle well before serving since this has a tendency to separate, with the hot pepper component rising to the top. I didn't shake it before testing it on my finger tip and found it to quite potent, providing some amusement for my son.<br /><br />This is a very different and enjoyable hot sauce that provides both heat and flavor!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 2, \"value\": \"This Tabanero \\\"Hot ...\"}, \"We have several relatives with dietary restrictions in my family, including gluten and dairy sensitivity, so I was happy to try these Pamela's \\\"Oat Chocolate Chip Coconut\\\" snack bars.

I am an energy drink fan and have developed a taste for the stuff, so liked the flavor of these quite a bit more than my wife that hardly ever uses energy drinks (more of a coffee purist).<br /><br />The \\\"Green Thunder\\\" reminds me of Mountain Dew with a hint of apple flavoring and the \\\"Black Cherry\\\" tastes like, well, Black Cherries. I personally prefer the \\\"Green Thunder\\\" but my teen son and my wife like the flavor of the \\\"Black Cherry\\\" better.<br /><br />These do provide a decent energy boost and the portable bottle makes it convenient to carry with me since they do not have to be refrigerated after opening.

That being said, this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South-Western dishes, but I wouldn't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes. There are hotter sauces available, but this one is a good balance of flavor and heat.<br /><br />There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"\\\"Dave's Insanity ...\"}, \"This illy issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink is very nice served over ice!

We are fortunate to have Indian friends who occasionally invite us to dinner but since we can't always count on an invitation whenever a craving comes on one us, these pre-made packets are a reasonable substitute. Here are my observations:<br /><br />Pros -<br />+ Good Flavor; as noted above, this tastes very good to people that like Indian food (my mother hates it)<br />+ Mildly Spicy; this rates on low to medium of the spicy scale, might be too much heat for some since it \\\"stays with you\\\"<br />+ Low Carb; 22.5g Total Carbs - 5g Dietary Fiber = 17.5 Net Carbs in each packet (see serving size info in \\\"Misc\\\", below)<br /><br />Cons -<br />- \\\"Not as Pictured\\\"; the picture on the packaging shows nice whole peppers, but they are actually cut up in the sauce<br />- Oily; this has a lot of oil that will rise to the top when cooking in a pot (we skim some off)<br />- High in Calories; each packet has 550 calories (400 from fat - but no Trans Fats)<br /><br />Misc -<br />* Serving Size; package says 2.5 per packet, we find that two packets when served with rice and bread is enough for our family of four<br />* Filling; this is a very heavy sauce based dish<br /><br />While not really a standalone meal, this is a good entree that can be used as the main course.

These flavors are from David Klein, the creator of the famous \\\"Jelly Belly\\\" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this sampler to review since my family loves jelly beans. Here are my opinions of the included flavors, in order of my favorites:<br /><br />* Coconut - Very strong natural coconut flavor, my favorite one<br />* Vanilla Bean - Very good tasting, natural vanilla flavor<br />* Pomegranate - Totally nailed this one! So good!<br />* Ginger - Crisp natural ginger flavor, every bit as good as the fresh ginger candy we get locally<br />* Cranberry - Really very good and natural tasting<br />* Root Beer - Amazing, can almost feel the fizz!<br />* Green Apple - So good! Very natural apple flavor!<br />* Peach - Very good juicy peach flavor<br />* Strawberry - Very good, reminds me of strawberry and cream<br />* Lemon - A little milder than expected, very good \\\"clean\\\" flavor<br />* Black Cherry - Very natural tasting but a tad bit over sweet<br />* Grape - Great grape flavor, not quite as strong as expected<br />* Orange Punch - Good flavor, not overpowering<br />* Blueberry - Good, but somewhat understated<br />* Himalayan Sea Salt - Very odd choice for a jelly bean, but it is a surprisingly enjoyable flavor<br />* Bacon - Does indeed taste like sweet smokey bacon, a fun novelty flavor but not one I'm going to eat all the time<br /><br />My list of favorites differs a little in order from other members of my family, as might be expected since everyone has different tastes, but every one of these rates higher than any other manufacturers similar jelly bean flavor we have tried. Combining some of these flavors is also fun with ginger and lemon being my favorite, producing a very clean and refreshing sensation.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with 100% natural flavors and colors, and includes an impressive list of fruit concentrates fairly high up in ingredients list.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"This David's ...\"}, \"These Golden Batch Sugar Free Peanut Wafers are really great tasting and are also fairly filling.

This \\\"Variety Pack\\\" contains several flavors, but the Sparkling Cola is my favorite as it has a crisp ginger taste that I really like and makes it very refreshing, especially when served very cold. The other flavors are: Green Tea Peach Mango (good), Green Tea Raspberry Acai (not my favorite), Sparkling Orange (very good), Sparkling Wild Berry (good), and Sparkling Ginger Ale (very good).<br /><br />While I can't really confirm that these actually burns 100 Calories just by drinking a whole can, it certainly would not surprise me since this does pack a serious kick. I now drink a can of this about a half hour before my workouts and it does seem to give me more energy throughout the whole hour and half or so. On occasions where I don't have time to grab a cup of my morning coffee, one of these does the job of waking me up just fine.<br /><br />A note of caution: I do have a high caffeine tolerance (cultivated through years of drinking \\\"too much\\\" coffee) so while this is fine for me, my teenage son tried one before his workout and got \\\"jittery\\\". Also, while not an issue about the drink, the cans are made of very thin aluminum and are prone to ripping if you crush them, causing sharp edges that can (and did) cut fingers.<br /><br />Overall, these are a very good tasting energy drinks that really do get you moving!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"Celsius Calorie ...\"}, \"This very enjoyable \\\"English Breakfast\\\" tea was included in the <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032D8IOC\\\">Celestial Seasonings K-Cups Tea Sampler 44 Cups (Pack of 2)</a> we bought for use in our <a href=\\\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA\\\">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>.<br /><br />It is a very rich, traditional tasting tea that works well in both small and large cup brew sizes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH\": {\"frequency\": 1, \"value\": \"This very ...\"}, \"Kirkland Jelly Beans are a great value and all 49 flavors are very good tasting.
